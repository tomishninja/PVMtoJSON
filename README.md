# PVMtoJSON
Converts PVM Files To A JSON Format for working with volumetric works with the files found at the Volume Libary link below.

http://schorsch.efi.fh-nuernberg.de/data/volume/


A large Portion of the code to make this work was created by Stefan Roettger please check out his works.
https://sourceforge.net/projects/volren/

## How to use this
This is still very early in development so far it is just a visual studio 2019. A complied version is yet to be built.

If you want to run it it takes 2 argumnets the first will be the source file that you can download at The Volume Libary and the second will be the JSON file you want to place this code into.

## This is still a work in progress
Please let me know by interacting with this git hub page if you are interested in this work and I will continue to build this project.
For now there is still a lot of testing left to do and its is still very early in development but if there are any fetures you want added back into this system please let me know in the issues section
